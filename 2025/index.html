      <h1>Data Meets Creativity: The Data Art 2025 Exhibition</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Data Art 2025 Exhibition, a celebration of creative visualisation and data-driven artistry. 

        <div class="callout">
          View the exhibition from <strong>12th May to 2nd June 2025</strong> at <a href="https://pontio.co.uk" target="_blank">Pontio</a> in Bangor, Wales. At the Arts and innovation centre at Bangor University, UK.</p>
        </div>
      <p>The Data Art 2025 Exhibition showcases a collection of innovative, thought-provoking artworks created by third-year students as part of the <a href="https://www.bangor.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate-modules/ICE-3121/202122">Creative Visualisation</a> module in the <a href="https://www.bangor.ac.uk/scse">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/">Bangor University</a>. This unique module invites students from computing disciplines to explore how data can be transformed into visual, and often emotional experiences.</p>

      <p>Blending data science, programming, and artistic expression, students produce original works that interpret real-world data sets—from environmental and social statistics to personal and abstract narratives—using visualisation techniques and creative technologies. Each piece reflects the students' ability to question, reimagine, and present data not just as information, but as a medium for storytelling and engagement.</p>
      <p>Rooted in the principles of authentic learning, this module challenges students to work on real projects with public impact, culminating in this public exhibition. It highlights how data can inspire creativity, raise awareness, and foster new ways of understanding our world.</p>
      <p>Data art turns information into visual stories. It combines elements of data visualisation, digital design, and traditional art to explore ideas in creative and meaningful ways.</p>
      <p> In this exhibition, data becomes more than numbers – it’s used as a subject, a tool, a structure, or even a spark of inspiration. These artworks show how facts and figures can be transformed into something expressive, emotional, and engaging.</p>

      <h2>2025 Exhibition Curation</h2>
      <p>This year's exhibit explores the fusion of data science and visual storytelling, curated by Professor Jonathan C. Roberts in collaboration with Dr Peter Butcher from Bangor University.</p>
      <p>As part of the Creative Visualisation module at Bangor University, students studying Computer Science, Data Science, Creative Technology or Computer Science with Games create original data art pieces.
        <p>Each student selects a dataset of personal or topical interest, explores artistic inspiration from established art styles and data artists, and experiments with alternative visual concepts. After sketching out their ideas, they bring their final work to life using Processing.org – transforming data into engaging and expressive visual art.</p>

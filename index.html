    <h2>Data art</h2>
    <p>
        We are pleased to announce the Call for Submissions for DataArt2024. 
        Data art is a form of artistic expression that leverages data to create visually 
        captivating and conceptually rich artworks. The topic merges the worlds of data 
        visualisation, digital art, and traditional art to convey complex information or 
        concepts in visually compelling and engaging ways. In data-art, there are numerous 
        avenues through which data can be utilised creatively; data can be the subject matter, 
        directly mapped to visual forms, an underpinning fundamental component, medium, 
        foundational data, or inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>We solicit artworks for exhibition, with accompanying manuscript. 
        The artworks must be suitable for wall display in the exhibition that will 
        take place between 20-27 May 2024 in Pontio, Bangor University. 
        A public opening and hands-on data-art workshop will take place on the 19th May. 
        The event aims to bring together researchers, scholars, artists, hobbyists, 
        and practitioners, to share their latest innovative ideas, and explore new avenues 
        in data art.

    <h2>Data art</h2>
    <p>
        We are pleased to announce the Call for Submissions for DataArt2024. 
        Data art is a form of artistic expression that leverages data to create visually 
        captivating and conceptually rich artworks. The topic merges the worlds of data 
        visualisation, digital art, and traditional art to convey complex information or 
        concepts in visually compelling and engaging ways. In data-art, there are numerous 
        avenues through which data can be utilised creatively; data can be the subject matter, 
        directly mapped to visual forms, an underpinning fundamental component, medium, 
        foundational data, or inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>We solicit artworks for a temporary exhibition, with accompanying manuscript. 
        The artworks must be suitable for wall display in the temporary exhibition that will 
        take place between 20-27 May 2024 in <a HREF="https://www.pontio.co.uk/Online/">Pontio,
            Bangor University</a>. 
        A public opening and hands-on data-art workshop will take place on the 19th May. 
        The event aims to bring together researchers, scholars, artists, hobbyists, 
        and practitioners, to share their latest innovative ideas, and explore new avenues 
        in data art. Accepted manuscripts will be edited into a monograph.
    </p>

    <p>
 <ul>

<H2>Requirments and general expectations</H2>
<p>
      We invite submissions of original data-art works, along with 
    accompanying manuscript, on various aspects related to data-art. 
    We encourage new, novel, and interesting art pieces.
</p>
    <ol>
<li>
       Artworks must be original, and the author(s) must hold appropriate 
    permissions and copyright,
</li> 
    <li>
    Artworks must be presentable for wall display, and works must be able
        to be shown as figures in a report. Artworks must be below A1 size. 
        We envisage most art works to be A4 to A3 in size in print form.    
    </li>
    <li>
        Artworks must represent data, or inspired-by data in some way
    </li>
</ol>

<p>We encourage, and permit, submitted works to be based on research. 
    This could be from funded research and other projects. But the images themselves
    and the text of the manuscript must be original (i.e., different from 
    any published works, and not infringe any copyright). 
    </p>
<p>
    The work must be created and authored by the author(s), who must hold 
    copyright and relevant permissions to present data or pictures thereof. 
    Submissions will be edited into an accompanying monograph, that will be 
    published, and arranged by the organisers. Acknowledgements of funders,
    data sources, and other acknowledgements must be added to the submitted 
    manuscript. References and relevant citations to related work, inspirations, 
    techniques, or published works must be include, if suitable, up to a maximum of
    5 references.
</p>

    <h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>Authors are required to submit a manuscript that explains their work. 
    Importantly the manuscript must explain (1) the artwork itself and how 
    it shows or uses data, (2) the techniques and methods you have used to 
    create it, and (3) how you were inspired and what it shows. </p>
<p>The manuscript will include title of the work, photograph or digital 
    image of the art, label (using the specified format) that will be 
    used alongside the artwork, a written description of the data, 
    inspiration and mappings, and references and acknowledgements. 
    The author(s) of any accepted submissions will be invited to 
    attend the opening and workshop on the 19th May. Authors also agree, 
    by submission, that the organisers will reformat and edit their manuscripts 
    into a coherent publishable monograph. The monograph will be available to
    accepted authors, and publicly available later. In their manuscript 
    submission, authors should include details of any underpinning data 
    such as the data types and origins of the data, information of how 
    the data is mapped onto the display, as well as any design inspiration, 
    design process, and the overall creation process. </p>
<p>Submissions will undergo a review process by the organisers, and 
    their decision is final. Accepted papers will be presented at the 
    exhibition and published in the conference monograph.</p>
